# Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?
A modern software development technique that allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.
In Machine Learning are several different kinds of techniques:

 - In  **supervised learning**, every training sample from the dataset
   has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a
   result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.
   
   In  **reinforcement learning**, the algorithm figures out which
   actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a
   number) on the way to reaching a specific goal.
   
   In  **unsupervised learning**, there are no labels for the training
   data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying
   patterns or distributions that govern the data.

## Components of Machine Learning
There are 3 components in Machine Learning.
### 1. Machine Learning Model
A framework that can be modified to solve different but related problems based on the data provided.
> A model is an extremely generic program(or block of code), made specific by the data used to train it. It is used to solve different problems.
#### Example: Selling of Snow Cones w.r.t Temp

### 2. Model Training Algorithm
Basic step in training a model:

 1. Think about the changes that need to be made (Inspect and Evaluate)
 2. Make those changes
 3. Repeat

### 3. Model Inference Algorithm
Using the trained model to generate predictions.
