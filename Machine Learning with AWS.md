# Machine Learning with AWS

### State of Machine Learning

- **Increased Spending**: By 2023, spending on AI systems will reach $98B, from $37.5B of 2019 `Src: IDC`
- **Piloting to Operationalizing**: By 2024, 75% of enterprise will shift from P to O AI `Src: Gartner`
- **ML Handles Real-World Tasks:** Advancements in GPUs, availability of data, new algorithms and the cloud.
- **Integrating ML into DevOps**: ML is not mainstream in DevOps `Src: Gartner`

### Why AWS?

The AWS machine learning mission is to put machine learning in the hands of every developer.

- AWS offers the broadest and deepest set of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services with unmatched flexibility.
- You can accelerate your adoption of machine learning with AWS SageMaker. Models that previously took months to build and required specialized expertise can now be built in weeks or even days.
- AWS offers the most comprehensive cloud offering optimized for machine learning.
